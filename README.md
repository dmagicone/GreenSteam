Just a tool to help add the needed files to the right places and edit the config.vdf file.

It creates a backup of the config.vdf file each time you use the app to make changes. 

The app remembers the location you specify for the Steam and Applist folders. You only have to specify the folder containing the lua + mani files.

This app assumes you have GreemLuma already installed and know how to install the games from the steam console prompt.

The code is probably a mess. Mostly done with the help of AI.
